## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the proivded design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Ideas to test yourself:

- Do your research on various HTML elements and ensure you use the most appropriate element based on the content.
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution to look similar to the design.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create custom list styling for both ordered and unordered lists. I used CSS counters for the custom number styling. and I learned how to use CSS counters for creating custom. I created a reusable class for the custom lists custom list style based on the figma design that allowed and I learned about the css-

Since all of the bulleted lists and numbered lists in the design had similar spacing and layout, I was able to reuse the same `<li>` structure for each list item:

```html
<!-- For numbered lists -->
<ol class="list custom-ol">
  <li class="text-preset-4 m-b-100">
    <span>List Item Text</span>
  </li>
  <!-- etc. -->
</ol>

<!-- For bulleted lists -->
<ul class="list custom-ul">
  <li class="text-preset-4 m-b-100">
    <span>List Item Text</span>
  </li>
  <!-- etc. -->
</ul>
```
Then I created a reusable `.list` class that I applied to all of the lists (Preparation time, Ingredients, and Instructions). (whether they were ordered or unordered). This contained all of the styling rules that they each shared.
```css
.list {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 100%;

    li {
        display: flex;
        width: 100%;
    }

    li::before {
        font-weight: bold;
        color: var(--color-rose-800);
        height: 100%;
        min-width: var(--spacing-500);
        padding-left: 8px;
        padding-right: 8px;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
}

/* It's also important to note that this is in my css-reset.css: */
ol,
ul {
  list-style: none;
}
```

Next, for the ordered lists, I created a class called `.custom-ol` and used the `counter-reset` property to create a counter, the `counter-increment` property to increment it, and the `content` property to add a period after each number.
```css
.custom-ol {
    counter-reset: css-counter;

    li {
        counter-increment: css-counter;
    }

    li::before {
        content: counter(css-counter) ".";
    }
}

```

For the unordered lists, I changed the `content` to a bullet point and vertically aligned it to the center of each block of text. 

```css
.custom-ul {

    li {
        align-items: center;
    }
    
    li::before {
        content: "â€¢";
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on writing semantic HTML and CSS in future projects.
